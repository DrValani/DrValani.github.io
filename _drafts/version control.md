My PhD source code was stored in a folder, and folder names followed sems versioning. 

A commit would involve copying the folder and updating the folder name. As well as a README file, with a message on the changes. 

Reverting/Rolling back was simple: Delete the folder. 

Why did I do it like this. I didn't know any better. And being the only person to work on this code ment I didn't need anything more.
