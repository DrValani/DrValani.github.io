####Point of contact

Each team at 7 digital had a person designated to be a first point of contact. This is rotated either daily, weekly or by determined by the task you are working on. 

Any queries, issues (including production), ticket the poc is responsible for handling. 

What are the benefits:

1. all other team members can focus on their tasks. Reduces context switching.
 * knowledge is shared within the team. Mitigates against having a single point of failure. 
* regardless of if you are a junior or senior, just started or have been at the company for years. You are responsible for the team's software.
* different people looking at the same problem, more likely to be solved. For example. Locker resets. A production issues in our android app ment users where incorrectly reaching their download limit. So the customers servive team would raise a ticket to have the download limit reset. Poc would then run a http call using curl to reset the limit. 
* feeling of importance within the team and company. 

The next poc(Michael), improved this by creating a console app which the team would use. Thus only needing to input some variables. 

Then the next poc (John the ninja Nye) took this one step further and added the functionality to the web tool that the customer  service team used. After that no further tickets where raised. 

Do's and Don't

Do ask for help when you don't know the answer to a question. 

When having to make changes to production. Do ask for a pair. An extra pair of eyes can make all the difference. 


Don't bullshit. If you don't know something, just be honest and day you don't know. 

Don't just redirect someone to someone else. Take them to the team member and make sure the query has been answered. Who knows you may get the same question again. 


Implementing poc requires a certain discipline. The whole team has to be on board. If a question comes to you and you are not poc, ask the person to approach poc. Even if this means eventually poc coming back to ask you the same question. This is about respecting poc, ensuring you only get disturbed. 

Interrupted pair for 15 mins takes 1hour to get back to work.
