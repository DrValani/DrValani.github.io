Working in an agile software development we continuously break down stories or features in small deliverables. Attempting to identify the minimum viable product.  

From Kent Becks book on writing user stories. In this article we focus on a smell (indicator) that the story may not be broken up correctly. 

The sign is when you break down a story into two, but the user will not see the value when both are complete,such that the user will not see any difference until both stories are complete. 

For tech teams work on it such a task it works well, because they have implemented what each layer at a time, and that is value for them. 

However, as beck states it important to try developing or interacting with all the layers.
