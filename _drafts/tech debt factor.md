The problem. 

Things moving too slowly. Always seems to be a heap of things to do before we get to the business end of things.  

Trial having a grace period after each feature is complete or bug fixed. The team get a bit of time to fix something they didn't like. 

This is what currently happens in the team. A feature needs to be developed or added. But before we can work on that we have a host of stuff to do first. And so it takes ages for us to even get started on the actual functionality.  

What I hope to achieve. Get team to focus on delivering business value first. Get it to production and get feedback as quickly as possible. 

Once that's done, I want the devs to clean up what they have worked on. 


The proposed algorithm. 

Grace period is = Time spent getting feature to production * tech debt factor 

The tech debt factor is determined by the team and possibly agreed with by the business.
