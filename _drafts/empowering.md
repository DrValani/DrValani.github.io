There is a lot of documentation in agile practices on making developers feel empowered.

I have heard many theories, but it wasn't until my time working at 7digital did I know exactly what this means.

The first sign that you are empowered is not wanting your boss's job, or any other seniors. This is not an indication of not having enough drive, but it's the feeling that your ideas are listened to, sometimes taken on board. Or even that you just get on with it.
