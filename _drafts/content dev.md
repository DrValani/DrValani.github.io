**** What do I want:

To be able to release and rollback at easily. So I can make small iterative safe changes to the production system.

To be able to monitor my production releases. So that I am aware of any errors I may have introduced and fix it accordingly.

Easily deploy and run all services so that e2e test run on my dev box pointing to my local rabbitmq and local db. So that I can thoroughly test changes potentially stop pushing broken code. To do this I need to be able to deploy all my services locally.

I want a system were errors and failures are loud and clear. So that I can fix them quicker.

I want to the reduce the time I spend yak shaving!
